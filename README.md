### What we do:
We are helping **small to mid-sized manufacturers** - manufacturers that have not entirely automated their processes and have a human element involved - keep up with the technology to **stay competitive**. Collecting **data** will give them the **competitive edge** - knowing where they are in each step of the workflow process, understanding if there are anamolies or bottlenecks in their processes, and pricing their products fairly and reasonably will help them analyze and understand efficient business practices. The data collection method right now is inaccurate, requires tedious user entry, or is delayed and estimated. We intend to fix that.

### How will we fix it?
After conducting user research and a literary review, we analyzed the data to come to the conclusion: there needs to be an easy, efficient way to **time work-orders** in a workflow process that is **non-invasive** to a user. 

### Our Idea: 
We intend to develop a voice-based technology to start and stop tracking time orders. We will create the skill to find unique voices, connect it to a work-order, and insert the information to the database. We will also design and develop a mobile UX to visualize the information in the database. This will help understand the big picture of the user-inputted data.

### Tools and Deployment:
We will be using miro to design the sequence of conversation for the voice-based technology. Please see our miro file <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kvGl6vk=/"> here. </a> We will be building skills using VoiceFlow software. To develop this skill, simply create the necessary elements on VoiceFlow, and upload to the Alexa skill. We will be using AWS to upload variables, utterances and slots, so the data can be collected in one place.


### Code and Mobile Mockups:
For our database: Our code includes creating tables in the AWS server, according to our Entity-Relationship Diagram. It is comprehensive of the primary keys, foreign keys, associative entities, and the relations we need to keep track of in the workflow process. 
<br> 
For our mobile UI: Our code includes backend and frontend development, where our mobile UI displays necessary information, visualizations, and code pulled from the backend database.

### Who we are:

We are students at the University of Washington, majoring in Informatics. We are completing our Capstone project, reflecting what we have learned at our time in UW.
