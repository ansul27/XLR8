### What we do:
We are helping **small to mid-sized manufacturers** - manufacturers that have not entirely automated their processes and have a human element involved - keep up with the technology to **stay competitive**. Collecting **data** will give them the **competitive edge** - knowing where they are in each step of the workflow process, understanding if there are anamolies or bottlenecks in their processes, and pricing their products fairly and reasonably will help them analyze and understand efficient business practices. The data collection method right now is inaccurate, requires tedious user entry, or is delayed and estimated. We intend to fix that.

### How will we fix it?
After conducting user research and a literary review, we analyzed the data to come to the conclusion: there needs to be an easy, efficient way to **time work-orders** in a workflow process that is **non-invasive** to a user. 

### Our Idea: 
We intend to develop a voice-based technology to start and stop tracking time orders. We will create the skill to find unique voices, connect it to a work-order, and insert the information to the database. We will also design and develop a mobile UX to visualize the information in the database. This will help understand the big picture of the user-inputted data.

### Who we are:

We are students at the University of Washington, majoring in Informatics. We are completing our Capstone project, reflecting what we have learned at our time in UW.
