    <h1>About XLR8</h1>
    <h3>Project Description:</h3>
    <p>XLR8's mission is to help small to mid-sized manafacturing companies stay 
        competitive by implementing voice-controlled non-intrustive technology
        to assist them in accurately tracking the time it takes to complete work orders 
        for their clients.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Users Should Care:    </h3>
        <p>Users should care about this because this implementation of voice-controlled time tracking 
            is a non-intrusive method of accurately determining how long it takes for manual work orders
            to be completed inside of manfacturing plants. While the product we're developing mainly caters
            to the manafacturing plants that aren't very large, our deliverable will be able to, by zone in 
            the plant and using a worker's voice, be able to tell exactly how long a client's work order 
            took to fix from beginning to end. By having this data available, companies and manafacturing sites 
            can determine and define their financials accurately, allocate money and resources more effectively
            and, in the long run, save company resources. 
        </p>

        <p>A manafacturing plant such as the one below with different zones 
            would benefit from the introduction of voice-assisted time-tracking technology. Because 
            so many zones and work stations are dedicated to different components of the work order process,
            time tracking here would be instrumental in ensuring we know exactly how long each part of the process
            took.

        <p>Our voice-enabled time-tracking will be done through Alexa skills. We will be developing our Alexa skill
            and connecting it to a back-end database provided by Xemelgo, and ensuring that the information is stored
            properly with as minimal human interference as possible.
